# BubbleServer
My Rust Starter Project
## A multi-cliented TCP server library
BubbleServer is my first project in Rust where I wanted to uphold to best practices and really test my knowledge with the language,

BubbleServer makes it easy to create  a TCP server that can be used for any purpose, e.g follow the example provided,
where I quickly made a TextChat server (with a provided client to test)
